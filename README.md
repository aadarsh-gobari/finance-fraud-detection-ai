# finance-fraud-detection-ai
AI-based financial fraud detection system focused on U.S. financial security and economic protection.

## Model Performance Summary

The project evaluates multiple machine learning models, progressing from a transparent 
baseline to a production-grade boosting model. Performance improvements demonstrate the 
value of advanced AI techniques in detecting rare but high-impact fraudulent activities 
within financial systems.

## Deployment Readiness

The fraud detection model is designed for real-world deployment and can be integrated 
into transaction monitoring systems through a lightweight inference pipeline.

The system supports real-time fraud risk scoring and can be embedded into financial 
workflows to enable proactive fraud prevention while maintaining transparency and 
regulatory compliance.
