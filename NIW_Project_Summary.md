# EB-2 NIW Project Summary – Financial Fraud Detection

## Project Title
AI-Based Financial Fraud Detection System to Strengthen U.S. Financial Security

## Field of Endeavor
Applied Machine Learning, Financial Security, Explainable AI

## Problem Addressed
Financial fraud results in billions of dollars in economic losses annually and undermines 
consumer trust in digital payment systems. Traditional rule-based systems struggle with 
evolving fraud patterns and high false-positive rates.

## Proposed Solution
An end-to-end machine learning system utilizing imbalance-aware models and explainable AI 
techniques to detect fraudulent transactions accurately and transparently.

## National Importance
The project supports U.S. economic security by improving fraud detection capabilities, 
reducing financial losses, and enabling trustworthy AI deployment in regulated financial 
environments.

## Evidence of Qualification
- Advanced machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Quantitative performance improvements (ROC-AUC, Fraud Recall)
- Explainable AI implementation (SHAP)
- Deployment-ready inference pipeline
- Clear documentation and reproducibility

## Conclusion
This work demonstrates the applicant’s ability to advance AI-driven financial security 
solutions of national importance, justifying a waiver of the labor certification requirement.
